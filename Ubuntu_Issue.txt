Q> using apt install getting error msg "No sandbox user '_apt' on the system, can not drop privileges"

A> _apt user missing in ubuntu. Add user
The user _apt is created by the postinst script of the apt package (/var/lib/dpkg/info/apt.postinst):

 # add unprivileged user for the apt methods
 adduser --force-badname --system --home /nonexistent  \
     --no-create-home --quiet _apt || true

It's the owner of /var/cache/apt/archives/partial and /var/lib/apt/lists/partial and used by APT to download packages, package list, and other things.
